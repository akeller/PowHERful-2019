# Think-Chatbot-101-Lab

You should be able to complete this lab in 10-15 minutes! If you'd like to continue working on your chatbot after the lab, there will be additional steps to include more advanced techniques and even deploy.

This lab will walk you through creating a chatbot to guide the user through creating a support ticket. Instead of a traditional form or wizard, this chatbot can offer a more personalized approach, soliciting more quality information from the user to build the most informative support ticket.
