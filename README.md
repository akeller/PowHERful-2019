# 101 Lab: Build Your Own Chatbot in 15 Minutes or Less

You should be able to complete this lab in 10-15 minutes! If you'd like to continue working on your chatbot after the lab, there will be additional steps to include more advanced techniques and even deploy.

This lab will walk you through creating a chatbot to guide the user through creating a support ticket. Instead of a traditional form or wizard, this chatbot can offer a more personalized approach, soliciting more quality information from the user to build the most informative support ticket.

In IBM Cloud there are often multiple ways to accomplish the same steps. In the steps outlined below, you should consider this one way to accomplish a given task.

## Create an instance of the Watson Assistant service

Navigate to the IBM Cloud dashboard. Click ```Catalog``` in the upper menu bar.

This will load a full list of all available services in the Catalog. Click ```AI```.

You should see all the AI services in IBM Cloud, including the Watson API Services and data science tools and platforms. Click ```Watson Assistant```.

This starts the process of creating your Watson Assistant service. Make sure you give your service a good, descriptive name - ```Think 2019``` or just keep the autogenerated one. 

You can leave all the remaining feels with the defaults, including the Pricing Plan. Click ```Create```.

Depending on the connection, this next step may spin for a bit as your Watson Assistant service is being created. When the screen loads, notice your API key and URL. You'll need this information if you decide to deploy your bot after the lab. Click ```Launch tool```.

You are now ready to start building your bot!

## Create a Skill

Your Watson Assistant instance should load and take you to a page where you can see information about the steps to build your assistants. Click ```Create a Skill``` to start building.

If you had skills already created, you would see them below. Click ```Create new```.

Name your skill something useful - ```Support Ticket```. If you or your users speak a language other than English, take note of the available options in the language dropdown.
